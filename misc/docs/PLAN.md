# Plan for Implementation of game Fate: Defenders of Grimheim on BGA

This document is a plan for the implementation of the game Fate: Defenders of Grimheim on Board Game Arena (BGA). It outlines the steps and tasks required to create a digital version of the game that can be played online.

This document also referred as TODO list.

## Documents

See misc/docs/DESIGN.md for preliminary design
See misc/docs/RULES.md for game rules
See CLAUDE.md for project overview

## Prepare game assets

[x] Read the rulebook of Fate: Defenders of Grimheim and create RULES.md.
[x] Assets of the game including rulebook PDF located at ~/Develop/bga/bga-assets/
[x] Main Board (jpg) — img/EN_Game_Board.jpg
[x] Cards (jpg) — monster cards sprite exists (img/EN_Monster_Cards.jpg), hero cards
[x] Miniatures (png) — hero sprites (img/mini_heroes.png), house sprites (img/mini_houses.png), monster sprites
[~] Other 3d pieces and iconography (png) — dice sprite done (img/dice.png), crystals TODO

## High level plan

[x] Transform templated project into typescript enabled
[x] Copy boilerplate code from another game: tokens db, machine db, common utils, etc
[x] Phase 1: Core game framework and board setup
[x] Phase 2: Basic player turn with one hero (reduced rules)
[x] Phase 3: Monster system with one monster type (spawning + movement done)
[x] Phase 4: Combat and damage system
[x] Phase 5a: Hero attribute trackers (strength, range, move, health)
[~] Phase 5: Equipment, quests, and upgrades — equipment activation done, quests not tracked yet
[x] Phase 6: Full monster turn (movement, attack, reinforcements)
[x] Phase 7: Add remaining monster types and legends (all 3 factions done in Iter 2)
[x] Phase 8: Add remaining heroes
[ ] Phase 9: Polish, animations, and BGA compliance
[ ] Phase 10: Testing and alpha release

## Iteration 0: Skeleton Game Loop (No Real Rules)

**Goal**: Game starts, shows board with map, each player has a hero on the board. Player can do "practice" (gain 1 XP) or "move" (click hex to move hero). Then monster turn just advances time track. Game ends when time track runs out. **Playable end-to-end on BGA.**

**What already exists**: hex map rendering, token framework, Op_turn scaffold, Op_actionMove/Op_actionPractice stubs, state machine wiring.

### Game Elements

[x] Add hero miniature tokens (hero_1..hero_4) — token_material.csv
[x] Add house tokens (house_0..house_9) — token_material.csv
[x] Add rune stone token — token_material.csv
[x] Add crystal tokens (green, red, yellow) — token_material.csv
[x] Add action marker tokens — token_material.csv

### Server

[x] `setupNewGame()`: create 1 hero per player in Grimheim, create rune stone on time track position 1, create town pieces (houses) in Grimheim
[x] `Op_actionPractice`: implement — gain 1 XP (increment player counter)
[x] `Op_actionMove`: implement — player picks a hex, hero moves there (no validation yet beyond "is it a hex on the map")
[x] `Op_turnEnd`: reset, schedule next player or when everybody did one turn - schedule turnMonster
[x] `Op_turnMonster`: advance rune stone on time track by 1 step, Win/loss check: if time track reaches end → win. (Loss condition deferred)
[x] `getAllDatas()`: should work

### Client

[X] Show hero tokens on map at their hex positions
[X] Practice action: button that sends action to server, updates XP counter
[X] Move action: click hex → send target hex to server → animate hero move
[x] Show time track position (rune stone counter or simple text)

### Validation

[x] Deploy to BGA studio, start a 1-player game, take turns, game ends

---

## Iteration 1: Basic Movement Rules

**Goal**: Movement follows actual rules — up to 3 steps, can't enter lakes/mountains (for heroes), can't pass through occupied hexes, entering Grimheim ends movement.

### Server

[x] Implement adjacency helper functions in Game PHP:

- `getAdjacentHex($hexId)` — returns list of adjacent area IDs (hex id is hex_9_9)
- `getHexTerrain($hexId)` — returns terrain type
- `isOccupied($hexId)` — checks if a character is on this area
- `getMoveDistance($hexId, $otherHexId)` - distance beetwin hexes, if adjecent its 1, if one of them invalid its -1

[x] Movement validation: check terrain, occupied hexes, max 3 steps
[x] Grimheim special rules: entering ends movement, exiting can go to any adjacent non-mountain hex
[x] Reachability calculation: given hero position, return set of valid destination hexes (`getReachableHexes()`)

### Client

[x] Highlight reachable hexes when move action is active

### Tests

[x] PHP unit tests for movement validation and reachability

---

## Iteration 2: Monsters on the Board (Static)

**Goal**: Monsters appear on the board. No movement or combat yet — just spawning from monster cards during reinforcement.

### Game Elements

[x] Add monster tokens game element — monster_material.csv
[x] Add monster card game element — monstercard_material.csv

### Server

[x] Define monster tokens in material (goblins only to start — Trollkin rank 1) — already in monster_material.csv
[x] Monster card data: define a few yellow monster cards with goblin placement
[x] `Op_reinforcement`: draw monster card, place goblins at specified locations
[x] Trigger reinforcement on time track spots marked with crossed axes
[x] Heroes can't move into hexes occupied by monsters — done in Iteration 1

### Client

[x] Render monster tiles on map hexes — placeholder circles with faction color and name label
[x] Add proper monster sprite graphics (img/mini_monsters.png) and update css

### Tests

[X] PHP tests for monster placement from cards

---

## Iteration 3: Monster Movement

**Goal**: Monsters move toward Grimheim on monster turn, following paths/arrows/roads. Monster entering Grimheim destroys a town piece.

### Server

[x] Monster path calculation: arrows → roads → Grimheim — `getMonsterNextHex()` + `getDistanceMapToGrimheim()` in HexMap.php
[x] Monster movement order: closest to Grimheim first — `getMonstersOnMap()` sorts by distance
[x] Movement rules: don't move if adjacent to hero, can't enter occupied hex — `moveMonsterOneStep()` in Op_turnMonster.php
[x] Monster entering Grimheim: remove monster + remove 1 town piece — `monsterEntersGrimheim()`, legends destroy 3
[x] Loss condition: all town pieces destroyed (Freyja's Well is last) — `isHeroesWin()` in Game.php

### Client

[x] Animate monster movement (snap-to-position is fine)
[x] Show town piece removal

### Tests

[x] PHP tests for monster pathfinding — 8 tests in MonsterMovementTest.php
[x] PHP tests for movement order — sorting + closest-first integration tests
[x] Integration test: monsters reach Grimheim → town piece removed — house destruction, Freyja's Well, legend, charge tests

---

## Iteration 4: Basic Combat

**Goal**: Heroes can attack adjacent monsters. Simple dice rolling, damage tracking, monster death.

### Game Elements

[x] Add attack dice game element — token_material.csv, dice_material.csv, Tokens.scss, Game.ts

### Server

[x] `Op_actionAttack`: select adjacent monster, roll dice, apply hits as damage
[x] `getAreasInRange($areaId, $range)` — for ranged attacks
[X] Dice system: implement die faces (hit, hit-with-cover, miss, rune), roll N dice
[X] Hero attack strength: just base hero value for now (no equipment/abilities)
[X] Damage tracking on monsters (red crystals placed on monster/hero)
[X] Monster killed: remove from board, gain XP
[X] Cover: if monster is in forest, hit-with-cover doesn't count

### Client

[X] Attack action: highlight adjacent monsters, click to attack
[X] Show dice results (text/simple display, no animation needed yet)
[X] Show damage on monster tokens
[x] Show monster death

### Tests

[x] PHP tests for dice rolling and hit calculation
[x] PHP tests for damage and monster death

---

## Iteration 5: Monster Attacks

**Goal**: After movement, monsters adjacent to heroes attack. Hero damage, knocked out heroes.

### Server

[x] Monster attack phase: all monsters adjacent to heroes attack
[x] Monster attack strength from monster data
[x] Trollkin faction bonus: +1 per adjacent trollkin
[x] Damage to hero (counter on hero card/token)
[x] Knocked out: damage >= health → hero to Grimheim, damage set to 5, remove 2 town pieces
[x] `Op_actionMend`: remove 2 damage from hero (5 if in Grimheim)

### Client

[x] Show monster attacks in log
[x] Show hero damage counter
[x] Show knocked out animation (hero moves to Grimheim)
[x] Mend action UI

### Tests

[x] PHP tests for monster attack resolution
[x] PHP tests for knocked out hero handling

---

## Iteration 6: Full Game Loop with Goblins

**Goal**: Complete playable game with Trollkin goblins only. All 6 actions work. Short time track. Win/loss conditions. This is the true MVP.

### Server

[x] `Op_actionPrepare`: draw 1 event card
[x] `Op_actionFocus`: add 1 mana to a card
[x] Action selection: enforce "must pick 2 different actions" rule
[x] Charge: on skull time track spots, monsters move +1 extra
[x] Goblin special: moves 2 instead of 1

### Client

[x] Action selection UI: show 6 action buttons, disable already-picked action
[x] End turn button
[x] Undo support for action selection

### Tests

[x] Integration test: full round (all players turn + monster turn) — Campaign_BjornSoloTest
[x] Test win condition (survive time track)
[x] Test loss condition (all town pieces destroyed)

---

## Monsters: Brutes and Trolls

**Goal**: Full Trollkin faction. Brutes (rank 2) and Trolls (rank 3) with higher stats.

### Server

[x] Add brute and troll token types and material data — all 3 factions (trollkin, firehorde, dead) with 3 ranks each defined in monster_material.csv
[x] Add monster cards that spawn brutes and trolls — all 54 cards defined in monstercard_material.csv
[x] Red monster card deck (has stronger monsters) — 18 red cards defined, Op_reinforcement supports deck parameter
[x] Reinforcement: yellow cards on yellow spots, red cards on red spots — Op_reinforcement handles both decks

### Client

[x] Different visual for brutes and trolls vs goblins — all 9 monster types have distinct CSS in Minis.scss with rank-based sizing

### Tests

[x] Test mixed monster spawning and movement — Op_reinforcementTest covers brutes/trolls

## Monster Faction (Fire Horde)

### Server

[x] Fire Horde monster data and tokens — done in Iter 7
[x] Range 2 attack for Fire Horde monsters — Monster::getAttackRange(), Op_monsterAttack uses getHexesInRange()
[x] Monster cards that spawn Fire Horde monsters — done in Iter 7

### Client

[x] Fire Horde visual styling — done in Iter 7

### Tests

[x] Test range 2 attacks — MonsterTest, Op_monsterAttackTest, HeroTest, Op_actionAttackTest

---

## Monsters: Dead + Legends

### Server

[x] Dead faction monster data — done in Iter 7
[x] Runes count as hits for Dead attacks — Character::applyDamage() checks attacker faction
[x] Draugr armor (prevent 1 damage each time) — Character::getArmor(), beginDefense(), armor absorbs in applyDamage()
[x] Legend monsters: unique stats, destroy 3 town pieces, swap movement — material + movement done in Iter 3/7
[x] Legend reinforcement: legend cards spawn legend tokens + escort monsters — Op_reinforcement
[x] All 54 monster cards defined — done in Iter 7

### Client

[x] Dead faction visual styling — done in Iter 7

### Tests

[x] Test Dead faction effects — MonsterTest: rune-as-hit, draugr armor, armor absorb/reset
[x] Test Legend special rules — MonsterMovementTest: legend destroys 3 houses, legend movement

---

---

## Iteration 8: Hero Cards (1 Hero)

**Goal**: Pick simplest hero. Implement hero card, starting equipment, starting ability. Equipment gives attack bonus.

### Game Elements

[x] Add hero card game element (all heroes) — card_material.csv, Cards.scss, Game.ts
[x] Add hero card sprite for first hero — img/<hero>\_hero_cards.jpg

### Server

[x] Define first hero's card data (hero card, 1 starting ability, 1 starting equipment)
[x] Equipment: attack strength bonus
[x] Focus action: actually adds mana to ability/equipment cards — Op_actionFocus, Op_actionFocusTest

### Client

[x] Player board: show hero card, active ability, active equipment
[x] Card tooltips with effects
[x] Activate equipment/ability buttons (free actions)

### Tests

---

## Iteration 9: Event Cards and Prepare Action

**Goal**: Event card deck works. Prepare action draws cards. Cards can be played as free actions.

### Server

[x] Event deck setup: shuffle at game start
[x] Prepare action: draw 1 event card, hand limit 4 — Op_actionPrepare queues Op_drawEvent
[x] Op_drawEvent: auto-draws if hand < 4, else asks player to discard or skip
[x] Op_discardEvent: discard a card from hand to discard pile
[x] Play event: select from hand, discard, apply effect — Op_playEvent queues effect operations from `r` column

### Client

[x] Hand display (private to player)
[x] Play card from hand
[x] Discard interface when at hand limit — Op_drawEvent shows hand cards to pick

### Tests

[x] Test draw, play, discard cycle — Op_drawEventTest, Op_discardEventTest, Op_actionPrepareTest
[x] Test hand limit enforcement — Op_drawEventTest

---

## Iteration 9.5: Card Effect Operations

**Goal**: Implement the generic parameterized operations that are building blocks for event/equipment/ability card effects. These are queued by `playEvent`/`useEquipment`/`useAbility` after a card is played. See DESIGN.md "Card Effect Operations" for full notation.

### Operations (new Op\_ classes)

- [x] `dealDamage` (Countable) — Deal X damage to target character (no dice). Used by: Kick, Courage, Lightning Bolt, Rain of Fire, Swift Kick, etc.
- [x] `heal` (Countable) — Remove X damage from target hero. Used by: Rest, Stitching, Belt of Youth, etc.
- [x] `roll` (Countable) — Roll X attack dice against target monster. Used by: Snipe, Hard Rock, Chain Lightning, Fire Spark, etc.
- [x] `move` (Countable) — Move hero up to X areas. Used by: Agility, Maneuver, Fleetfoot, Quick Reflexes
- [x] `moveMonster` — Move target monster X areas. Used by: Kick, Swift Kick, Bowling
- [x] `killMonster` — Kill target monster matching filter (rank, health, range). Used by: Back Down, Short Temper, Heat Death, In Charge
- [x] `gainXp` (Countable) — Gain X gold/XP. Used by: Miner, Popular, Discipline
- [x] `gainMana` — Add X mana to target card. Used by: Power Surge, Elementary Student
- [x] `spendMana` — Remove X mana from source card (cost). Used by: mana-activated abilities
- [x] `spendDurab` — Add 1 damage to equipment card (durability cost). Used by: equipment activated effects
- [x] `addTownPiece` — Add 1 Town Piece to Grimheim. Used by: Inspire Defense (`in(Grimheim):2spendManaAny:addTownPiece`)
- [x] `preventDamage` (Countable) — Prevent up to X incoming damage. Used by: Dodge, Stoneskin, Riposte, Dreadnought
- [x] `repairCard` — Remove X damage from target card. Used by: Durability, Sewing
- [x] `performAction` — Queue an additional main action. Used by: Speedy Attack, Rapid Strike, Sophisticated
- [x] `spendAction` — Consume a main action slot without performing it. Used by: event cards that cost an action
- [x] `drawEvent` — already exists, make Countable for multi-draw (Starsong)
- [x] `spendGold` — Remove X yellow crystals (gold/arrows) from the context card as a cost. Parallel to `spendMana`. Used by: Black Arrows (`spendGold:3addDamage`), future "spend token from card" effects.
- [x] `spendUse` — Cost op that marks the context card as used this turn (flips card token state→1). Voids with `ERR_OCCUPIED` if already used; reset by `Op_turnEnd`. Replaces the implicit `Card::setUsed()` path so once-per-turn is explicit in each card's `r` expression. Used by: most voluntary free-action abilities/equipment (Stitching, Sure Shot, Snipe, Fleetfoot, Fortified, Rapid Strike I, Leather Purse, Throwing Axes/Darts/Knives, Belt of Youth, etc.). NOT used by: on-triggered cards (trigger-on-other-actions exception), damage-prevention equipment, "any number of times" cards, `r=custom` bespoke classes, Rapid Strike II (explicit "several times per turn"), Black Arrows (spendGold naturally throttles).
- [x] `on(EventXxx)` — Runtime event gate. Voids with `ERR_PREREQ` unless the `event` data field (seeded by `Card::useCard()`) matches the expected event. Used inside `r` expressions to restrict a clause to a specific trigger context. Must be the leftmost element of its paygain chain so `Op_paygain::getPossibleMoves` catches the void before any sub runs. Used by: Flexibility I/II (`on(TActionAttack):2spendMana:2addDamage` — add-damage branch fires only mid-attack and does NOT consume the card's spendUse slot).

### Extensions to existing ops

- [x] `addDamage` — accept a defender-filter expression param like `Op_dealDamage` already supports (e.g. `1addDamage(true,trollkin)` for Trollbane). Added `trollkin`/`firehorde`/`dead` bareword terms in `Game::evaluateTerm`.
- [x] `dealDamage` — added `adj_attack` param meaning "monsters adjacent to the current attack target hex" (via `getAttackHex()`, excluding the attack hex itself). Used by Bone Bane Bow and Fireball II. Kept as a special case inside `Op_dealDamage::getPossibleMoves()` rather than in `Hero::getRangeFromParam` since it's not hero-centered.
- [x] `repairCard` — add param `max` 

### Card class hierarchy (implemented)

[x] Op_trigger refactored into pure dispatcher — walks tableau + hand, instantiates Card objects per card, calls `onTrigger($triggerType)`.
[x] `Model/Card` base class with `onTrigger`, `canTrigger`, `canBePlayed`, `queue`, `getUseCardOperationType`.
[x] `Model/CardGeneric` — default class for cards without a bespoke subclass. Implements the standard voluntary trigger flow.
[x] `Cards/CardEquip_HomeSewnCape` — first bespoke card. Passive `onRoll`: adds 1 mana per rune rolled.
[x] `Game::instantiateCard($card, $op)` — factory resolving bespoke class from Material `name` field, falling back to `CardGeneric`.
[x] `Op_turnStart` — fires `trigger(turnStart)` at start of each player turn, then queues `turn`. Call sites updated.

### Remaining blocker: `enter` trigger for equipment placement

- [x] **`enter`** trigger — fires when an equipment card enters the tableau. Needed by Black Arrows to seed 3 yellow crystals on equip. Implemented via `effect_gainEquipment` + `onEnter()` hook.

### Integration

- [x] `playEvent` resolve: parse `r` column notation, queue corresponding operations
- [x] Operation parser: target params `(adj)`, `(self)`, `(inRange)` — already supported via `getParam()`
- [x] Operation parser: chaining with `;` and cost notation with `:` — already supported

---

## Iteration 10: Equipment and Ability Activation

**Goal**: Equipment and abilities can be activated as free actions. Equipment has durability cost. Abilities cost mana. Hero card effect applies during relevant actions.

### Server

[x] Equipment: once-per-turn activation — useAbility/useEquipment check card state==1, reset in turnEnd
[x] Ability: once-per-turn activation — same mechanism
[X] Ability: costs mana
[x] Hero card effect applies during relevant actions — trigger system handles on=roll etc, hero cards in candidate list
[x] `useEquipment` resolve: parse `r` column, handle `spendDurab:effect` cost
[x] `useAbility` resolve: parse `r` column, handle `spendMana:effect` cost

### Tests

[x] Test ability activation and mana spending
[x] Integration tests: use equipment with durability cost → effect executes
[x] Test equipment attack bonus

---

**Goal**: Equipment cards have quests. Completing quests unlocks new equipment. Upgrade system (spend XP to gain abilities or improve cards).

### Server

[~] Quest definitions on equipment cards — quest column exists in card_equip_material.csv but no gameplay tracking
[ ] Quest progress tracking
[ ] Quest completion → new equipment active
[x] `effect_gainEquipment($cardId, $owner)` — places an equipment card on the player's tableau and fires `trigger(enter)`. Should be called from quest completion, upgrade flow, and starting equipment setup ([Game.php:127](modules/php/Game.php#L127)). Black Arrows ("starts with 3 arrows here") and Tiara ("starts with 6 gold here") need this for their `onEnter` hook to fire.
[x] Upgrade cost track: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...
[x] End-of-turn upgrade option: spend XP for new ability or card improvement
[x] Mana generation at end of turn — Op_turnEnd iterates cards with mana field, generates crystals

### Client

[ ] Show damage and mana on cards as crystal counters (unlike hero/monster damage buckets which are icons)
[ ] Fix missing animation when damage crystals are removed from cards (e.g. repairCard/Durability)
[ ] Quest progress display on equipment cards
[ ] Upgrade prompt at end of turn
[ ] Ability pile and equipment pile browsing

### Tests

[ ] Test quest completion conditions
[x] Test upgrade cost calculation

---

---

## Hero Attribute Trackers

**Goal**: Store hero attributes (strength, range, move, health) as persistent tracker tokens in the DB so card effects can temporarily modify them mid-turn. Trackers are recomputed from base card values at end of turn.

### Server

[x] Add tracker token definitions to token_material.csv (tracker_strength, tracker_range, tracker_move, tracker_health)
[x] Hero.php: `recalcTrackers()` computes base values from tableau cards, `incTrackerValue()` bumps mid-turn
[x] Hero.php: `calcBaseStrength()`, `calcBaseRange()`, `calcBaseMove()`, `calcBaseHealth()` — base computation methods
[x] Hero.php: `getAttackStrength()`, `getAttackRange()`, `getMaxHealth()`, `getNumberOfMoves()` — read from trackers
[x] DbTokens.php: `incTrackerValue()` convenience method
[x] setupGameTables: create tracker tokens per hero, call `recalcTrackers()`
[x] Op_turnEnd: call `recalcTrackers()` to reset at end of turn
[x] Op_actionMove: read move count from `hero->getNumberOfMoves()` instead of hardcoded 3
[x] getAllDatas: removed manual counter blocks (trackers sent automatically)
[ ] Add `tracker_armor` for consistency with other stats — move armor out of Material-only read path so it can be modified by cards

### Client

[x] Game.ts: hero tooltips read from tracker tokens instead of manual counters; added Move attribute

---

## Iteration 13: Remaining Heroes

## Bjorn Card Validation

Verify each of Bjorn's cards works correctly.
Hero, Abilities and Equipment:

- custom should not part of r it should be implemented first
- the rule (r) actuall does what text description say
- if triggered, test should exists for all trigger conditions and negative conditions
- make sure it resolves propertly using integration test


### Bjorn Equipment Cards 


All verified
(All equipment missing quests)


### Server Hero 2 - Alva

All verified
(All equipment missing quests)


### Server Hero 3 - Embla

Triage of r=custom cards (DSL = composable rule expression; extend op = small op change; bespoke = needs Card* class):

#### Ability Cards

[ ] card_ability_3_5 In Charge I — when you use action move, lead 1 adjacent hero along. **Triage: extend op** — extend `Op_actionMove` with a "lead-hero" sub-choice after destination pick (co-move legality requires shared target, can't compose in DSL).
[ ] card_ability_3_6 In Charge II — lead up to 2 adjacent heroes. **Triage: extend op** — same extension as 3_5 with count=2.
[x] card_ability_3_11 Queen of the Hill I — "Deal 2 damage to an adjacent monster and switch places with it." `r=2c_queen`. Implemented via `Op_c_queen` (extends `Op_dealDamage`, adds swap via `Op_step`). Multi-occupancy supported after HexMap refactor. has tests
[x] card_ability_3_12 Queen of the Hill II — "Deal 4 damage to an adjacent monster and switch places with it." `r=4c_queen`. Implemented via `Op_c_queen` (same op as I, count=4). has tests
[ ] card_ability_3_9 Reaper Swing I — after attack, deal 1 to all other adjacent monsters. **Triage: extend op** — extend `Op_dealDamage` with a multi-target broadcast filter (e.g. `adj_all,not_attack_target`), then `r=dealDamage(adj_all,not_attack_target)` on=TAfterActionAttack.
[ ] card_ability_3_10 Reaper Swing II — 2 damage to all adjacent monsters (confirm inclusion of attack target). **Triage: extend op** — same multi-target filter as 3_9; `r=2dealDamage(adj_all)` on=TAfterActionAttack.

#### Equipment Cards

[ ] card_equip_3_19 Blade Decorations — passive +1 strength, r= empty (strength column handles it). Needs integration test.
[ ] card_equip_3_22 Raven's Claw — main weapon, r=2addDamage on=TActionAttack. Needs integration test.
[ ] card_equip_3_21 Wildfire Blade — main weapon, r=dealDamage(adj) on=TAfterActionAttack. Needs integration test.

#### Event Cards

[ ] card_event_3_34 Magic Runes — runes always count as hits for you (one-shot). **Triage: bespoke** — needs `CardEvent_MagicRunes`. Rune-as-hit is currently a faction rule hardcoded in `Character::countHit()`. Bespoke class sets a per-attack flag consumed by `countHit`, or on=TRoll adds countRunes extra hits. Small hook needed in Character to read the card flag.
[ ] card_event_3_29 Sophisticated — perform a focus action, then perform another main action. **Triage: extend op** — extend `Op_performAction` to accept a "main" category that prompts among attack/move/practice/mend. Then `r=performAction(actionFocus),performAction(main)`.

### Server Hero 4 - Boldur

Triage of r=custom cards:

#### Ability Cards

[ ] card_ability_4_5 Sweeping Strike I — passive +1 damage per attack + chain-on-kill to "clockwise" next adjacent monster. **Triage: bespoke** — needs `CardAbility_SweepingStrikeI`. Spatial "clockwise" neighbor selection has no primitive (c_nailed is "behind", not clockwise); combines passive addDamage with custom TMonsterKilled routing.
[ ] card_ability_4_6 Sweeping Strike II — same + damage scales with number of adjacent monsters. **Triage: bespoke** — `CardAbility_SweepingStrikeII`; no `addDamage(countAdjMonsters)` counter primitive. Share base with I.
[ ] card_ability_4_7 Wrecking Ball I — move into occupied hex, deal 1 and push occupant. **Triage: extend op** — extend `Op_actionMove` (or new `Op_c_wrecking` invoked from move) to permit occupied-hex entry and push (dealDamage + moveMonster/moveHero). CSV text differs from early prompt — verify with Victoria.
[ ] card_ability_4_8 Wrecking Ball II — Wrecking Ball I + passive +1 move. **Triage: extend op** — reuse 4_7 extension for ram; +1 move is DSL (`1gainAtt(move)` on turn start).

#### Equipment Cards

[ ] card_equip_4_20 Dvalin's Pick — r=spendAction(actionAttack):gainXp:gainMana:drawEvent. Needs integration test.
[ ] card_equip_4_25 Dwarf Pick — main weapon, r= empty (strength column handles it). Needs integration test.
[ ] card_equip_4_22 Eitri's Pick — +2 dice when using Rapid Strike. **Triage: bespoke** — needs `CardEquip_EitrisPick`. Trigger is conditioned on "action originated from Rapid Strike card" (card_ability_4_3/4_4). No DSL filter for "action triggered by a specific ability card" — multi-trigger routing like `CardEquip_BloodlineCrystal`.
[ ] card_equip_4_19 Orebiter — attack adjacent mountain areas, gain XP per damage. **Triage: bespoke** — needs `CardEquip_Orebiter`. Attacking terrain (not a monster) has no primitive; plus per-damage XP hook via TResolveHits. Could split into `Op_attackTerrain` + a TResolveHits hook, but the terrain-attack alone warrants a bespoke class.
[ ] card_equip_4_21 Smiterbiter — main weapon, stores up to 3 excess damage on kill, spend stored to add damage. **Triage: bespoke** — needs `CardEquip_Smiterbiter`. Stateful card-local crystal bank (like `CardEquip_Tiara`) + two flows (store-on-kill, spend-to-add-damage).

#### Event Cards

[x] card_event_4_32 Berserk — "Take 1 unpreventable damage to add 3 damage to this attack." `r=spendHealth:3addDamage` on=TActionAttack. Implemented via new `Op_spendHealth` (bypasses the dealDamage→preventDamage pipeline). has tests
[ ] card_event_4_36 Boldur's Gate — r=in(Grimheim):2spendGold:addTownPiece. Needs integration test.
[ ] card_event_4_38 Portable Smithy — r=spendAction(actionPrepare):gainEquip ("complete quest" = gain top of equip deck). Needs integration test.

#### Summary — new ops and op extensions (Embla + Boldur)

**New ops:**
- `Op_c_reaper` (Reaper Swing) — standalone op that **replaces** normal attack damage resolution: prompts the player to divide the attack's damage budget between the primary target and a second adjacent monster. Triggered by the card on TActionAttack.
  - card_ability_3_9 Reaper Swing I: *"In each attack action, you may divide the damage you deal between the target and another adjacent monster."*
  - card_ability_3_10 Reaper Swing II: same text, strength +3.

**Op extensions:**
- `Op_actionMove` — allow entering occupied hex with ram/push semantics.
  - card_ability_4_7 Wrecking Ball I: *"Boldur may move into occupied areas. Deal 1 damage to that character and move it 1 area."*
  - card_ability_4_8 Wrecking Ball II: *"Boldur may move into occupied areas. Deal 1 damage to that character and move it 1 area. You have move +1."*
  - May be factored as `Op_c_wrecking` invoked from move.
- `Op_performAction` — accept a "main" category that prompts among attack/move/practice/mend.
  - card_event_3_29 Sophisticated: *"Play in Grimheim to perform a mend, focus, prepare, or practice action."*

**No new op (bespoke `Card*` classes):** Sweeping Strike I/II (clockwise neighbor + adj-count), Eitri's Pick (source-conditioned trigger), Orebiter (terrain attack + per-damage XP), Smiterbiter (stateful excess-damage bank).

**DSL-only (no code changes beyond existing ops):** Blade Decorations, Raven's Claw, Wildfire Blade, Dvalin's Pick, Dwarf Pick, Boldur's Gate, Portable Smithy, Magic Runes (`r=3addDamage(rolledRune)` on=TRoll), In Charge I/II (`r=killMonster(adj,'rank<=1')` / `rank<=2` on=TActionMove — uses existing `Op_killMonster`), +1 move on Wrecking Ball II. All need integration tests only.

## Iteration 15: Polish and BGA Compliance

**Goal**: Animations, game log, responsive layout, BGA publishing requirements.

### UI/UX

[ ] Smooth movement animations (hero and monster)
[ ] Dice roll animation
[ ] Card play/draw animations
[ ] Responsive layout
[ ] Card zoom on hover
[ ] Visual indicators (current turn, threats, quest progress)

### BGA Requirements

[x] `getGameProgression()` based on time track
[ ] `zombieTurn()` for disconnected players
[ ] Game statistics in stats.json
[ ] All strings translatable
[ ] Tooltips on all interactive elements
[ ] Input validation review (security)
[ ] Private info check (event cards in hand)

### Testing

[ ] Full game playthrough (short + long track)
[ ] All hero combinations
[ ] All player counts
[ ] Edge cases (multiple knockouts, legend interactions, empty decks)
[ ] Pre-alpha BGA checklist (see below)

## TODO

- Fix stacked tooltips
- [x] Add hero stats to tooltip (health, attack strength from hero card on tableau)
- Check if damage dice (8 in rules) are meant to be limited or just a physical constraint — verify on BGG forum or designer notes
  [ ] Fix spawn locations in monster cards — current data is not correct
  [ ] Add crystal sprite graphics and update CSS (currently using colored circle placeholders)
  [ ] Show win/loss end screen — BGA default end screen works, custom UI
  [ ] Range indicator for ranged monster attacks
  [ ] Legend monster special display
  [ ] Suppressive Fire multiplayer bug: `findStunCrystal()` in Op_c_supfire finds the first green crystal on any monster globally — in multiplayer (Bjorn + Alva both have Suppressive Fire), one player's resolve/skip could move or remove the other player's stun crystal
  [ ] Flip animation for upgrades
  [ ] Main weapon - restriction only one main weapon allowed
  [ ] **Manually test: double-confirm on comma-chained event card rules.** Multi-Shot (`r=2roll(inRange),2roll(inRange)`) creates a `seq` op for the comma-chain. Test via `Campaign_AlvaEventTest::testMultiShotRollsAgainstTwoDifferentMonsters` shows an extra `confirm` step is required after the card pick, before the first sub-op prompts. The root paygain already has `confirm=true` from `Card::useCard`; seq's expandOperation correctly strips confirm from children. Expected UX: click card → prompt for first monster hex (no intermediate confirm). Actual: click card → confirm button → prompt for first monster hex. Verify in the harness whether this is a UX bug (double-click) or intentional. If UX bug, likely fix is in `Op_seq::expandOperation` or how useCard wraps the op.
